## Key Trends
### Revenue
- **Peak Days:**  
  - **Jul 11:** $6.9K (+38% spend, revenue spike noted).  
  - **Jul 25:** $8.9K record, linked to engagement surge (+134%).  
- **Recent:** Sep 18–24 saw daily revenue dip to **$1.3K–3.7K**, materially below Jul/Aug benchmarks.

### Efficiency (MER/ROAS)
- **July:** Strong efficiency, MER >8 most days; highlight on **Jul 10–11** with spike >15.  
- **August:** Moderated MER ~4–6 range.  
- **September:** Further softening, 7-day MER at **4.59** vs 28-day avg **3.99**; short-term bounce but still well below July highs.  

### Costs
- **CAC:**  
  - July lows: ~$6–$11.  
  - August–September averages climbed significantly: 7-day = **$20.3**, 28-day = **$23.0**.  
  - Efficiency erosion tied to rising CAC.  

### Engagement
- **Strong Engagement:** Late June to early July (content virality drove both orders and new followers).  
- **Recent Weeks:** Sporadic engagement spikes (e.g., Sep 6 & Sep 7 with >7.5K and >3.8K likes), but overall inconsistent.  

---

## Anomalies Detected
- **Jul 10–11:** MER and revenue spike despite falling engagement (-74%). Paid efficiency unusually high.  
- **Jul 25:** Revenue surge (+$8.9K) aligned with higher engagement (+134%) — likely viral content/offer resonance.  
- **Sep 11:** MER improved sharply (+10.16) while engagement dropped -38% — efficiency from spend concentration.  

---

## Strategic Implications
- **Growth Dependency on Virality:** Spikes in both revenue and MER were tied to viral content days (Jul 8–11, Jul 25). Sustained growth unlikely without consistent engagement drivers.  
- **Efficiency Pressure:** CAC has doubled since early July; September figures show revenue contraction vs ad spend effort.  
- **Scaling Risk:** August–September data suggests diminishing returns on higher spend — revenue plateau despite elevated impressions/views.

## Recommendations
1. **Content:** Reinvest in creative formats proven effective in early July → replicate high-engagement campaigns.  
2. **Spend Discipline:** Reassess September budget allocations — rising CAC indicates wasted spend; optimize around top-performing audiences/creatives.  
3. **Retention Play:** With AOV relatively stable (~$87–89), profitability hinges on repeat purchases. Implement retention/loyalty campaigns to offset high CAC.  
4. **Testing:** Introduce structured daily budget caps; scale responsive content but cut low-performing spend promptly.  
5. **Benchmark Reset:** Track against July’s high-efficiency baseline, but set more sustainable target metrics: MER ≥5, CAC <$20.

## Next Steps
- **By Sep 30, 2025:** Deliver segmentation on which creatives fueled Jul 25 and Sep 6–7 spikes.  
- **By Oct 7, 2025:** Roll out content testing calendar (TikTok-style virality formats).  
- **By Oct 15, 2025:** Report on impact of budget optimization — measure MER stabilization vs current 4.6 baseline.  

---  
**Bottom Line:** After a strong July, efficiency has declined. Immediate action is needed to restore CAC discipline and re-engage audiences with proven content strategies.

# Growth & Marketing Performance Brief  

---

## Metrics in Plain English  
- **MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio, same as ROAS)** = Revenue ÷ Ad Spend. Shows efficiency of ad spend.  
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** = Ad Spend ÷ Orders. Shows how much ad spend it takes to acquire each order.  
- **AOV (Average Order Value)** = Revenue ÷ Orders. Shows how much the average customer spends per order.  
- **RPM (Revenue per Mille)** = (Revenue ÷ Views) × 1,000. Revenue per thousand ad views.  
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** = Clicks ÷ Views. Indicates ad engagement.  
- **Run Rate** = Units ÷ 28 days. Average daily unit sales for inventory planning.

## 1. What are our three biggest opportunities for growth? (What/Why/How next week)  
- **Opportunity 1: Hero Product Deepening (Grey Noire Hoodie)**  
  - *What*: Hoodie drove $18.1K (21.4% of 28-day revenue).  
  - *Why*: It’s a proven lead product; outsized demand and strong SKU pull.  
  - *How next week*: Increase ad weight behind Grey Noire hoodie on Meta/IG with tailored creatives, test new audiences, and pair with bundle offers to raise AOV.  

- **Opportunity 2: Broaden Creative Testing**  
  - *What*: Top creatives show very low CTR (0–0.3%) despite revenue generation.  
  - *Why*: Indicates missed opportunity in thumb‑stop content; revenue driven by scale, not efficiency.  
  - *How next week*: Rapid testing of UGC (user-generated content), motion-first assets, and value-prop hooks to lift CTR and improve CAC by ≥10%.  

- **Opportunity 3: Funnel Segmentation & Naming Hygiene**  
  - *What*: Campaign naming lacks TOF/BOF (Top of Funnel/Bottom of Funnel) labels.  
  - *Why*: Without clear segmentation, we risk under/over-investing across funnel stages.  
  - *How next week*: Rename campaigns with standardized structure (e.g. `[TOF] Lookalike Hoodie Test`, `[BOF] Retarget Cart`). Reallocate spend using 70/20/10 (TOF/BOF/Testing).

## 2. Accounting for seasonality... is the revenue accelerating or slowing down?  
- **Seasonality trend**: Revenue is **sloping down at –$45/day**.  
- **7-day vs 28-day**: $17.7K vs. $87.0K → drop in momentum.  
- **MER delta (7d–28d)**: +0.57, meaning efficiency has improved recently, but growth pace is weaker.  
- **Conclusion**: Revenue is slowing despite more efficient returns. Likely a sign of under‑scaled spend or summer seasonality dip.  

---

## 3. What customer segments do we have... how do we get more?  
- **Current state**: Campaign names provide no clarity on segments (TOF vs BOF not labeled).  
- **Action**: Implement naming hygiene with funnel stage + product + creative test markers. This will allow us to evaluate retention vs acquisition effectiveness and scale TOF prospecting with the right CAC guardrails.

## 4. What products truly pull demand (hero SKUs)... inventory for Q4/Q1?  

### Hero SKUs & Q4/Q1 Inventory Plan  
Formula = Run Rate × 45 days × Seasonality 1.20 × Safety Stock 1.15  

SKU / Product | Revenue (28d) | Units (28d) | Revenue Share | Units Share | Run Rate/day | Rec. 45d Units  
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  
Grey Noire hoodie — Grey Noire hoodie | $18,184.05 | 283 | 21.4% | 27.6% | 10.11 | 628  
Grey Noire Set — Grey Noire Set | $23,667.59 | 200 | 27.9% | 19.5% | 7.14 | 444  
Black Noire Set — Black Noire Set | $19,808.40 | 174 | 23.4% | 17.0% | 6.21 | 386  
Black Noire hoodie — Black Noire hoodie | $9,500.86 | 149 | 11.2% | 14.5% | 5.32 | 331  
Black Noire sweats — Black Noire sweats | $8,047.86 | 127 | 9.5% | 12.4% | 4.54 | 282  

**Conclusion**: The hoodie and sets are the strongest pull-through products. Double down on hoodie-led acquisition while ensuring inventory buffer for Q4 promotions.

## 5. How can we improve margins? What's killing margin post-purchase?  
- **Returns (10.4%)** are the biggest drag on net revenue. Likely fit/sizing issue with apparel.  
- **Shipping (8.0%)** is also significant.  
- **Discounts (3.5%)** are controlled but add up.  
- **Action plan**:  
  1. Invest in fit and sizing clarity (size charts, UGC fit videos).  
  2. Test flat-rate or free shipping threshold to reduce % share.  
  3. Limit sitewide discounts; substitute with bundles to retain AOV.  

---

## 6. Does marketing work? Which parts add incremental value?  
- **Paid works**: Paid channels (labeled “Other”) drove **$283K on $21.8K spend (ROAS 12.98, CAC $0.13)**.  
- **Issue**: Report scope likely partial (paid-only) since orders/revenue don’t align with sitewide totals. Need to reconcile organic + SMS contribution.  
- **Conclusion**: Marketing is highly efficient, but data hygiene by channel is incomplete → fix tracking for next report.  

---

## 7. Which creatives actually move product on IG?  
- **RPM range**: $15–$24 per 1,000 views.  
- **CTR**: All at 0.0% due to tracking gaps or low click depth.  
- **Interpretation**: Current creative assets are not thumb-stopping — revenue is scaled by impressions, not efficient performance.  
- **Action**: Launch high-frequency creative sprint with bold design & UGC to lift RPM ≥ $35 and CTR to at least 0.5%.  

---

## Additional Insights  
- **Revenue efficiency up, scale down** → Spend is too conservative. Efficiency gains could support +20–30% more spend without breaking CAC/MER guardrails.  
- **Return rate is too high for scaling apparel** → Set a target of <7% return rate for Q4/Q1 to sustain gross margin.  
- **Creative wear-out likely occurring** → Same assets losing engagement velocity, hence high MER but declining topline.  
- **Inventory check**: Hoodie is both a hero SKU and likely bottleneck — keep >600 units minimum heading into Q4.  

---

## Executive Summary  
- **7-day revenue**: $17.7K  
- **28-day revenue**: $87.0K  
- **90-day revenue**: $336.9K  
- **Efficiency**: MER 4–5.4x across windows, CAC $16–22, AOV stable ~$87.  
- **Trend**: Revenue softening slightly, but efficiency is improving.  

**Strategic Priority**: Scale spend while protecting margins via reduced returns and stronger creative → maximize hoodie-led acquisition ahead of Q4.

Would you like me to also draft a **spend reallocation plan** (budget by campaign + SKU) for next week so you have exact tactical marching orders?

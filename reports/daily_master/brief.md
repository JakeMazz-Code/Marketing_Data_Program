**Metrics in Plain English**
- MER (same as ROAS) = Revenue / Ad Spend.
- CAC = Ad Spend / Orders.
- AOV = Revenue / Orders.
- RPM = Revenue / Views x 1,000.
- CTR = Clicks / Views.
- Run Rate = Units / 28 days.

## Top 3 Growth Opportunities (What & Why & How Next Week)
MER = Revenue / Ad Spend; CAC = Spend / Orders. Higher MER and lower CAC mean growth dollars are working harder.
1. **Scale efficient growth** - 7-day MER 4.56x is 0.57 above the 28-day baseline 3.99x, while CAC sits at $19.61 (28-day $21.86). Other contributes 100.0% of 28-day revenue at ROAS 14.94x.
   - Monday move: Shift the next test budget into Other and hold ROAS above 14.94x.
   - Funnel check: Label TOF and BOF campaigns so we can monitor mix as we scale.
   - Safeguard: Refresh creative the moment CAC drifts above $21.86 to preserve payback.
2. **Bridge the revenue run rate** - Daily revenue averages $2,529.19 vs $3,107.88 (28-day); slope is down. nan / Grey No√≠re Set - Medium drove $10,831.98 (11.9% of 28-day revenue). Run rate is 3.11 units/day; recommended 45-day stock is 193 units.
   - Monday move: Align promos and inventory around nan / Grey No√≠re Set - Medium and lock the next 45-day buy based on unit data insights.
   - Safeguard: Automate daily alerts when revenue drifts above or below target so we can adjust fast.
3. **Repair shipping leakage** - Last 28 days show $21,114.83 in shipping (5.4% of revenue).
   - Monday move: Audit the SKUs and promo codes driving the leak and set guardrails immediately.
   - Safeguard: Sync finance and marketing weekly so contribution targets stay protected while we scale.

## Revenue Trend - Accelerating or Slowing? (7d vs 28d vs 90d + Slope + MER)
We compare short-, mid-, and long-term revenue, MER (same as ROAS here), CAC, and the 56-day slope to spot acceleration.
- Latest data through 2025-09-24
- 7-day revenue $17,704.33 vs 28-day $87,020.56 vs 90-day $336,855.93
- MER: 7-day 4.56x; 28-day 3.99x; 90-day 5.36x
- CAC: 7-day $19.61; 28-day $21.86; 90-day $16.15
- 56-day revenue slope $-45 per day (down)

## Customer Segments - Best Cohorts & How to Get More
Segments are inferred from campaign/ad set names: Prospecting/TOF (cold audiences) versus Retargeting/BOF (warm audiences).
- Mixed / Unknown: Revenue $10,696.78 (100.0% share), MER 2.43x, CAC $35.73.
   - Growth move: Tag campaigns with TOF/BOF keywords to expose funnel performance.
   - Next step: Split mixed audiences by intent (viewed vs purchased) to rebuild clarity.

## Margin Leakage - What's Hurting Margin & Fixes
Margin leakage tracks discounts, returns, shipping, duties, and taxes as a share of net revenue; negatives erode contribution.
- 28-day revenue: $391,781.39
- Shipping: $21,114.83 (5.4% of revenue)
- Discounts: $-19,641.48 (-5.0% of revenue)
- Returns: $-13,360.89 (-3.4% of revenue)
- Taxes: $2,419.39 (0.6% of revenue)
- Duties: $0.00 (0.0% of revenue)
- Heaviest day: 2025-09-07 at $1,510.40

## Marketing Efficiency by Channel (ROAS, CAC, Share)
MER (same as ROAS here) = Revenue / Ad Spend; CAC = Spend / Orders; Revenue Share shows each channel's contribution over the last 28 days.
Channel | Revenue | Spend | Orders | ROAS | CAC | Revenue Share
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Other | $391,781.39 | $26,229.01 | 172,680 | 14.94x | $0.15 | 100.0%
- Other = 100.0% of 28-day revenue at ROAS 14.94x; CAC $0.15

## Creative Performance - Instagram (and TikTok if present)
RPM = Revenue / Views x 1,000; ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend; CTR = Clicks / Views. We highlight the top assets over the last 28 days.
Creative | Channel | Revenue | Revenue/1k Views | ROAS | CTR
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1.7855446047455308e+16 | Other | $5,695.10 | $145.15 | inf | 0.0%

## Additional Insights Uncovered (Model Reasoning)
- Data scope mismatch appears across sections: 28-day revenue is shown as $87,020.56 in multiple places but $391,781.39 in Margin Leakage and Channel; Orders are 999 in the KPI Appendix vs 172,680 in Channel. Hypothesis: sections may mix different scopes (e.g., sitewide vs paid-only) or have duplicated order events. Align data sources before scaling budget based on these figures.
- Creative diagnostics: top assets show ROAS as "inf" with CTR at 0.0%, yet meaningful RPM and revenue are reported. Hypothesis: spend and/or click tracking for Other may be missing, inflating ROAS and suppressing CTR. Validate pixels/UTMs and ensure spend is correctly captured prior to reallocations.
- Naming/attribution hygiene: product titles include artifacts (e.g., "nan" and "No√≠re") and Customer Segments show 100.0% under Mixed/Unknown. Hypothesis: inconsistent naming is hindering funnel and SKU rollups. Enforce a TOF/BOF naming taxonomy and clean SKU titles/codes to improve reporting fidelity.
